# soundBytes DrumKit  

This project is an enhanced and expanded version of the [Wes Bos JavaScript 30 Drum Kit](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/signin). I built on the original concept by adding a second instrument, new sounds, and improved interactivity for a more dynamic musical experience.  

## Overview  

The **soundBytes DrumKit** lets users play multiple virtual instruments using their keyboard. Each key corresponds to a different sound, with real-time visual feedback for an engaging experience.  

## Features  

- 🎵 **Two Instruments** – In addition to the original drum kit, I added a second instrument with its own unique sounds.  
- 🎹 **Keyboard Interactivity** – Play different sounds using designated keys.  
- 🎨 **Dynamic Visual Feedback** – Keys light up and animate when pressed.  
- ⏳ **Smooth Transitions** – CSS animations enhance the user experience.  

## Technologies Used  

- **JavaScript**: Handles event listeners, keyboard input, and sound playback.  
- **HTML & CSS**: Manages structure and styling, with CSS transitions for animations.  

## How It Works  

1. Press a designated key on your keyboard.  
2. The corresponding sound will play instantly.  
3. The key visually highlights, providing real-time feedback.  
4. The animation resets smoothly, ready for the next note.  
5. Switch between instruments to explore different sounds!  

## Installation & Usage  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh  
   git clone git@github.com:Kimberly-Rodriguez/KimberlyR_soundBytes.git
